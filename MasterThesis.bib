	abstract = {We provide evidence that recognition memory is mediated by a detect-or-guess mental-state model without recourse to concepts of latent-strength or multiple-memory systems. We assess performance in a two-alternative forced-choice recognition memory task with confidence ratings. The key manipulation is that sometimes participants are asked which of two new items is old, and the resulting confidence distribution is unambiguously interpreted as arising from a guessing state. The confidence ratings for other conditions are seemingly the resultant of mixing this stable guessing state with an additional stable detect state. Formal model comparison supports this observation, and an analysis of associated response times reveals a mixture signature as well.},

	abstract = {[Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 37(5) of Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition (see record 2011-14286-001). The authors reconstructed 59 data sets from published studies in which response bias had been manipulated experimentally. These data were fit with signal detection theory ({SDT)} and a two high-threshold model ({2HTM).} However, the G2 statistic for {SDT} fits was misspecified, and there were some errors in the reconstructed frequencies. These errors are corrected in the erratum.] [Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition on July 11 2011 (see record 2011-14286-001). The authors reconstructed 59 data sets from published studies in which response bias had been manipulated experimentally. These data were fit with signal detection theory ({SDT)} and a twohigh- threshold model ({2HTM).} However, the G2 statistic for {SDT} fits was misspecified, and there were some errors in the reconstructed frequencies. (The authors are greatly indebted to David Kellen, who noticed these issues and cross-checked the corrections.) Below are corrected results; the authors also (a) separately analyzed read and anagram word data from Buchner et al.’s (1995) Experiments 1 and 2, and (b) included reconstructed binary response results from Curran et al. (2007), Experiment 3. All data sets were reanalyzed by minimizing G2 for {SDT} and {2HTM} using various routines with converging results. Rather than presenting a corrected version of the complete 4-page appendix table in Bro¨der and Schu¨tz, the new G2 values are reported following the same order as the originally tabled studies from top to bottom, but with four instead of two data sets from Buchner et al. and four instead of three from Curran et al. Square brackets indicate which values stem from the same literature source to further facilitate their correct assignment.] Recent reviews of recognition receiver operating characteristics ({ROCs)} claim that their curvilinear shape rules out threshold models of recognition. However, the shape of {ROCs} based on confidence ratings is not diagnostic to refute threshold models, whereas {ROCs} based on experimental bias manipulations are. Also, fitting predicted frequencies to actual data is a more sensitive method for model comparisons than {ROC} regressions. In a reanalysis of 59 published data sets, the 2-high-threshold model ({2HTM)} fit the data better than an unequal variance signal detection model in about half of the cases. Three recognition experiments with experimental bias manipulation were conducted that yielded linear {ROCs} and a better fit of the {2HTM} in all cases. On the basis of actual data and a simulation, the authors argue that both models are at least equally valid as measurement tools and can perhaps be integrated theoretically.},
