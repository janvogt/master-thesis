	abstract = {People are generally skilled at using a confidence scale to rate the strength of their memories over a wide range. Specifically, low-confidence recognition decisions are often associated with close-to-chance accuracy, whereas high-confidence recognition decisions can be associated with close-to-perfect accuracy. However, using a 20-point rating scale, the authors found that the ability to scale memory strength had its limitations in that a high proportion of list items received the highest rating of 20. Efforts to induce participants to differentiate between these strong memories using emphatic instructions and alternative scales were not successful. Remember/know judgments indicated that these strong and hard-to-scale memories were often based on familiarity (not just recollection). Providing error feedback on a plurals discrimination task finally produced a high-confidence criterion shift. The authors suggest that the ability to scale strong (and almost perfectly accurate) memories may be limited because of the absence of differential error feedback for very strong memories in the past (the kind of differential error feedback that may account for the memory-scaling expertise that participants otherwise exhibit).

These errors are corrected in the erratum.] [Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition on July 11 2011 (see record 2011-14286-001). The authors reconstructed 59 data sets from published studies in which response bias had been manipulated experimentally. These data were fit with signal detection theory ({SDT)} and a twohigh- threshold model ({2HTM).} However, the G2 statistic for {SDT} fits was misspecified, and there were some errors in the reconstructed frequencies. (The authors are greatly indebted to David Kellen, who noticed these issues and cross-checked the corrections.) Below are corrected results; the authors also (a) separately analyzed read and anagram word data from Buchner et al.’s (1995) Experiments 1 and 2, and (b) included reconstructed binary response results from Curran et al. (2007), Experiment 3. All data sets were reanalyzed by minimizing G2 for {SDT} and {2HTM} using various routines with converging results. Rather than presenting a corrected version of the complete 4-page appendix table in Bro¨der and Schu¨tz, the new G2 values are reported following the same order as the originally tabled studies from top to bottom, but with four instead of two data sets from Buchner et al. and four instead of three from Curran et al. Square brackets indicate which values stem from the same literature source to further facilitate their correct assignment.] Recent reviews of recognition receiver operating characteristics ({ROCs)} claim that their curvilinear shape rules out threshold models of recognition. However, the shape of {ROCs} based on confidence ratings is not diagnostic to refute threshold models, whereas {ROCs} based on experimental bias manipulations are. Also, fitting predicted frequencies to actual data is a more sensitive method for model comparisons than {ROC} regressions. In a reanalysis of 59 published data sets, the 2-high-threshold model ({2HTM)} fit the data better than an unequal variance signal detection model in about half of the cases. Three recognition experiments with experimental bias manipulation were conducted that yielded linear {ROCs} and a better fit of the {2HTM} in all cases. On the basis of actual data and a simulation, the authors argue that both models are at least equally valid as measurement tools and can perhaps be integrated theoretically.

The authors discuss the methodological issues involved in conducting and analyzing {ROC} results, describe the various models that have been developed to account for these results, review the behavioral empirical literature, and assess the models in light of those results. The empirical literature includes studies of item recognition, relational recognition (e.g., source and associative tests), as well as exclusion and remember-know tasks. Nine empirical regularities are described, and a number of unresolved empirical issues are identified. The results indicate that several common classes of recognition models, such as pure threshold and pure signal detection models, are inadequate to account for recognition memory, whereas several hybrid models that incorporate a signal detection-based process and a threshold recollection or attention process are in better agreement with the results. The results indicate that there are at least 2 functionally distinct component/processes underlying recognition memory. In addition, the {ROC} results have various implications for how recognition memory performance should be measured. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2012 {APA}, all rights reserved).

In this approach, data are viewed as codes to be compressed by the model. From this perspective, models are compared on their ability to compress a data set by extracting useful information in the data apart from random noise. The goal of model selection is to identify the model, from a set of candidate models, that permits the shortest description length (code) of the data. Since Rissanen originally formalized the problem using the crude ‘two-part code’ {MDL} method in the 1970s, many significant strides have been made, especially in the 1990s, with the culmination of the development of the refined ‘universal code’ {MDL} method, dubbed Normalized Maximum Likelihood ({NML).} It represents an elegant solution to the model selection problem. The present paper provides a tutorial review on these latest developments with a special focus on {NML.} An application example of {NML} in cognitive modeling is also provided.},

We show that reliable results are obtained in a single session for 520 items and validate our method against previous findings by Snodgrass and colleagues for overlapping items. For these items, comparable levels of name agreement and latency are obtained, and we replicate effects of length, frequency, both objective and subjective age of acquisition, and visual complexity on reaction time ({RT)} and name agreement measures. Name agreement is unaffected by order of presentation, although there is a gradual increase in {RTs} across the session, requiring use of multiple random orders. Current extensions of our method include cross-linguistic, bilingual, developmental, and neuropsychological studies and comparisons of action naming and object naming.},

We assess performance in a two-alternative forced-choice recognition memory task with confidence ratings. The key manipulation is that sometimes participants are asked which of two new items is old, and the resulting confidence distribution is unambiguously interpreted as arising from a guessing state. The confidence ratings for other conditions are seemingly the resultant of mixing this stable guessing state with an additional stable detect state. Formal model comparison supports this observation, and an analysis of associated response times reveals a mixture signature as well.},

	abstract = {Simple visual discriminations such as detection of presence and recognition of small differences in the spatial and temporal patterns of objects have been explained in some detail in recent years by variants of the physical quantum theory. The present paper summarizes the status of an alternative group of theories, which is classed as neural, primarily to distinguish them from the physical quantum theory, and compares the two groups of theories. The neural theories are models of the visual system as a whole and include assumptions concerning the transformation of stimulus to sensory events, and the decision processes involved in discrimination. They are neural by inference only, and rarely specify the type of neural activity or the neural site at which the events occur. The bulk of the paper is devoted to a description of specific neural theories, attributable to the writer, concerned with (a) the detection process and the form of threshold probability data; and (b) the relation of threshold {ΔI/I} to I, and to the spatial and temporal characteristics of the stimulus. These theories are compared with selected related theories. The Swets-Tanner decision theory is contrasted with the present detection threshold theory and various lines of evidence are summarized. It is shown that data previously used to support the Swets-Tanner theory are inconclusive. Chief evidence against the Swets-Tanner theory comes from data obtained in a stimulus-comparison experiment, and from the contradiction implied when the relations assumed to exist between stimulus and sensory magnitudes over the threshold range are extended to a wider range. Evidence is presented which is in favor of the present theories and opposed to the neural theories of Graham and his colleagues which relate threshold {ΔI/I} to the spatial and temporal characteristics of the stimulus. This evidence comes primarily from detection thresholds for stimuli composed of twin spatial points or double temporal pulse, which the Graham theories cannot explain. In addition to spatial and temporal summation, double spatial and temporal stimuli exhibit probability summation whenever the sensory correlates of the stimuli exhibit twin modes. A 5–6 cps scanning mechanism is shown to exist which breaks up prolonged temporal stimuli and provides probability summation among the separate parts.},

The authors reconstructed 59 data sets from published studies in which response bias had been manipulated experimentally. These data were fit with signal detection theory ({SDT)} and a twohigh- threshold model ({2HTM).} However, the G2 statistic for {SDT} fits was misspecified, and there were some errors in the reconstructed frequencies. (The authors are greatly indebted to David Kellen, who noticed these issues and cross-checked the corrections.) Below are corrected results; the authors also (a) separately analyzed read and anagram word data from Buchner et al.’s (1995) Experiments 1 and 2, and (b) included reconstructed binary response results from Curran et al. (2007), Experiment 3. All data sets were reanalyzed by minimizing G2 for {SDT} and {2HTM} using various routines with converging results. Rather than presenting a corrected version of the complete 4-page appendix table in Bro¨der and Schu¨tz, the new G2 values are reported following the same order as the originally tabled studies from top to bottom, but with four instead of two data sets from Buchner et al. and four instead of three from Curran et al. Square brackets indicate which values stem from the same literature source to further facilitate their correct assignment.] Recent reviews of recognition receiver operating characteristics ({ROCs)} claim that their curvilinear shape rules out threshold models of recognition. However, the shape of {ROCs} based on confidence ratings is not diagnostic to refute threshold models, whereas {ROCs} based on experimental bias manipulations are. Also, fitting predicted frequencies to actual data is a more sensitive method for model comparisons than {ROC} regressions. In a reanalysis of 59 published data sets, the 2-high-threshold model ({2HTM)} fit the data better than an unequal variance signal detection model in about half of the cases. Three recognition experiments with experimental bias manipulation were conducted that yielded linear {ROCs} and a better fit of the {2HTM} in all cases. On the basis of actual data and a simulation, the authors argue that both models are at least equally valid as measurement tools and can perhaps be integrated theoretically.},

	abstract = {This article has two purposes. The first is to describe four theoretical models of yes-no recognition memory and present their associated measures of discrimination and response bias. These models are then applied to a set of data from normal subjects to determine which pairs of discrimination and bias indices show independence between discrimination and bias. The second purpose is to use the indices from the acceptable models to characterize recognition memory deficits in dementia and amnesia. Young normal subjects, Alzheimer's disease patients, and parkinsonian dementia patients were tested with picture recognition tasks with repeated study–test trials. Huntington's disease patients, mixed etiology amnesics, and age-matched normals were tested by Butters, Wolfe, Martone, Granholm, and Cermak (1985) using the same paradigm with word stimuli. Three major points are emphasized. First, any index of recognition memory performance assumes an underlying model. Second, even acceptable models can lead to different conclusions about patterns of learning and forgetting. Third, efforts to characterize and ameliorate abnormal memory should address both discrimination and bias deficits. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2012 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

We present an efficient method for computing the Fisher information approximation ({FIA)} to the normalized maximum likelihood index ({NML)} for these models, and a relatively efficient method for computing {NML} itself. This leads to a comparative evaluation of the complexity of the different models from the minimum-description-length perspective. Furthermore, we evaluate the goodness of the approximation of {FIA} to {NML.} Finally, model-recovery studies reveal that use of the minimum-description-length principle consistently identifies the true model more frequently than {AIC} and {BIC.} These results should be useful for research in recognition memory, but also in other fields (such as perception, reasoning, working memory, and so forth) in which these models play a role.},
